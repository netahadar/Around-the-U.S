# **Around the U.S**

==========================================================================
## Quick update, 30/08/21:
I've added some new features to the project so now you can add a new photo,
delete and like photos, and open a photo in full screen mode. Enjoy! :)
==========================================================================

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Basic JS" modul at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * JS foundations (variables, functions, strings etc.)
  * DOM
  * Event listeners
  * "classList" and it's methods
  * Controlling content using textcontent
  * forms
  * Using querySelector()
  * Working with arrays
  * Manipulating the DOM (create new element, move and remove elements, cloning etc.)
  * Template element
  * Create popups
  * Debugging
  * Git branches
  * Git merge and merge conflicts
  And more...

I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, serverside (data storage), anchors and vendor prefixes,
in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.

 Take a look at the project on gh-pages at the following link:
