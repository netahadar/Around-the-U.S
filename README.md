### update, 14/10/21:
I've organized the project according to OOP principals and added webpack
to it. 
The github page won't be available untill next update due to server side
upgrading.
Stay tuned :)

### New update, 10/09/21:
I've added a new feature to the project so now you can close popups by cliking
the Esc key / anywhere outside of the popup, and added form input validation. 
Have fun! :)

I've added some new features to the project so now you can add a new photo,

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Basic JS", "Modular JS" and "Applied JS" modules at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * JS foundations (variables, functions, strings etc.)
  * DOM
  * Events
  * Controlling content using textContent and innerHTML
  * Form validation
  * Using querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
  * Working with arrays
  * Manipulating the DOM (create new element, move and remove elements, cloning etc.)
  * Template elements
  * Create popups
  * OOP
  * Importing and exporting
  * Webpack
  * Debugging
  * Git branches
  * Git merge and merge conflicts
  And more...

I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, serverside (data storage), anchors and vendor prefixes,
in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.

 Take a look at the project on gh-pages at the following link:
