I've added a new feature to the project so now you can close popups by cliking
the Esc key / anywhere outside of the popup, and added form input validation. 
Have fun! :)

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Basic JS" modul at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * JS foundations (variables, functions, strings etc.)
  * DOM
  * Events
  * "classList" and it's methods
  * Controlling content using textcontent
  * Form validation
  * Using querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
  * Working with arrays
  * Manipulating the DOM (create new element, move and remove elements, cloning etc.)
  * Template element
  * Create popups
  * Debugging
  * Git branches
  * Git merge and merge conflicts
  And more...

I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, serverside (data storage), anchors and vendor prefixes,
in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.

 Take a look at the project on gh-pages at the following link:
