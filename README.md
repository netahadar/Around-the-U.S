The gh page is back live.
The project is now connected to a server and the initial photos are taken 
from it.
You can now add new photos, remove only the photos you've added, change 
profile name and description and change avatar.
Also, Iv'e added delete confirmation before deleting a card.

### update, 14/10/21:
I've organized the project according to OOP principals and added webpack
to it. 
The github page won't be available untill next update due to server side
upgrading.
Stay tuned :)

### New update, 10/09/21:
I've added a new feature to the project so now you can close popups by cliking
the Esc key / anywhere outside of the popup, and added form input validation. 
Have fun! :)

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Basic JS", "Modular JS" and "Applied JS" modules at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * JS foundations (variables, functions, strings etc.)
  * DOM
  * Events
  * Controlling content using textContent and innerHTML
  * Form validation
  * Using querySelector() and querySelectorAll()
  * Working with arrays
  * Manipulating the DOM (create new element, move and remove elements, cloning etc.)
  * Template elements
  * Create popups
  * Destructuring
  * OOP
  * Importing and exporting
  * Webpack
  * Working with API
  * Debugging
  * Git branches
  * Git merge and merge conflicts
  And more...

I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, serverside (data storage), anchors and vendor prefixes,
in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.
