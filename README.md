# **Around the U.S** 
## **By Neta Hadar Itzhak**

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "Basic JS" modul at Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * JJ foundations (variables, functions, strings etc.)
  * DOM
  * Events
  * "classList" and it's methods
  * Controlling content using textcontent
  * forms
  * Using querySelector()
  * Debugging
  * Git branches
  * Git merge
  * Merge conflict
  And more...

I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, serverside (data storage), anchors and vendor prefixes,
in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.

 Take a look at the project on gh-pages at the following link:
